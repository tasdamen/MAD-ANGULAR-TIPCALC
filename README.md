# MAD-ANGULAR-TIPCALC
This is a sample AnuglarJS application that demonstrates MVC where Model is the tip data object, controller responds to various user actions and the view is the calculator screen.

###Expected Behavior
The user should be able to enter tip either via typings or pressing the numbers. Resets lets your start over.

##LESSION 1 - PRACTICE
1. If you change the [ng-model](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel) to [ng-bind](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngBind) the text box stops to work Why?
2. If you change the [ng-model](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel) to [ng-value](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngValue) you see the text box but does it work? Hint: try typing something in the textbox
 
##LESSION 2 - PRACTICE
1. Instead of using hard-coded $ symbol using the currency filter to show the tip amounts
2. Whenever user enters an even amount show the word (even amount) next to the word Bill
3. Add a decimal button in the calculator
