# MAD-ANGULAR-TIPCALC
This is a sample AnuglarJS application that demonstrates MVC where Model is the tip data object, controller responds to various user actions and the view is the calculator screen.

###Expected Behavior
The user should be able to enter tip either via typings or pressing the numbers. Resets lets your start over.

##Few Comments
1. If you change the [ng-model](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel) to [ng-bind](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngBind) the text box stops to work Why?
2. If you change the [ng-model](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModel) to [ng-value](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngValue) you see the text box but does it work? Hint: try typing something in the textbox
